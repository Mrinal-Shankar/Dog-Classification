# Dog-Identification
<p> Deep Learning project to classify images of dogs according to their breeds</p>
<p> Coded in <b>Python</b> on Google Colab notebook using <b>Transfer Learning and TensorFlow 2.0</b>. Other libraries used include <b> Pandas, NumPy, MatplotLib </b>. The model used is an existing one from <b>TensorFlow Hub</b>. This multi-class image classification problem was done as part of Udemy course, 'Machine Learning: Zero To Mastery' and was a Kaggle competition in 2018. Data belongs to Kaggle and consists of a collection of 10,000+ labelled images of 120 different dog breeds.</p>
